```ts
const Utf8ErrorFuncs: Readonly<Record<"error" | "ignore" | "replace", Utf8ErrorFunc>>;
```

A handful of popular, built-in UTF-8 error handling strategies.

 **`"error"`** - throws on ANY illegal UTF-8 sequence or
 non-canonical (overlong) codepoints (this is the default)

 **`"ignore"`** - silently drops any illegal UTF-8 sequence
 and accepts non-canonical (overlong) codepoints

 **`"replace"`** - replace any illegal UTF-8 sequence with the
 UTF-8 replacement character (i.e. `"\\ufffd"`) and accepts
 non-canonical (overlong) codepoints
