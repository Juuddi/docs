The available Wordlists by their
 [ISO 639-1 Language Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
.

 (**i.e.** LangCz | cz, [en](/content/classes/LangEn.mdx), [es](/content/classes/LangEs.mdx), LangFr | fr,
 LangJa | ja, LangKo | ko, LangIt | it, LangPt | pt,
 LangZh | zh_cn, LangZh | zh_tw)

 The dist files (in the `/dist` folder) have had all languages
 except English stripped out, which reduces the library size by
 about 80kb. If required, they are available by importing the
 included `wordlists-extra.min.js` file.
