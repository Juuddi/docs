A **Log** in Ethereum represents an event that has been included in a
 transaction using the `LOG*` opcodes, which are most commonly used by
 Solidity's emit for announcing events.

## Extended by

- [`EventLog`](/content/classes/EventLog.mdx)

## Implements

- [`LogParams`](/content/interfaces/LogParams.mdx)

## Properties

| Property | Modifier | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `address` | `readonly` | `string` | The address of the contract that emitted this log. |
| `blockHash` | `readonly` | `string` | The block hash of the block this log occurred in. Use the<br /> [**Log.getBlock**](/content/classes/Log.mdx#getblock) to get the [**Block**](/content/classes/Block.mdx). |
| `blockNumber` | `readonly` | `number` | The block number of the block this log occurred in. It is preferred<br /> to use the [**Block.hash**](/content/classes/Block.mdx) when fetching the <br /> related [**Block**](/content/classes/Block.mdx), since in the case of an orphaned <br /> block, the block at that height may have changed. |
| `data` | `readonly` | `string` | The data included in this log when it was emitted. |
| `index` | `readonly` | `number` | The index within the block this log occurred at. This is generally<br /> not useful to developers, but can be used with the various roots<br /> to proof inclusion within a block. |
| `provider` | `readonly` | [`Provider`](/content/interfaces/Provider.mdx) | The provider connected to the log used to fetch additional details<br /> if necessary. |
| `removed` | `readonly` | `boolean` | If the **Log** represents a block that was removed due to an orphaned<br /> block, this will be true.<br /><br /> This can only happen within an orphan event listener. |
| `topics` | `readonly` | readonly `string`[] | The indexed topics included in this log when it was emitted.<br /><br /> All topics are included in the bloom filters, so they can be<br /> efficiently filtered using the [**Provider.getLogs**](/content/interfaces/Provider.mdx#getlogs) method. |
| `transactionHash` | `readonly` | `string` | The transaction hash of the transaction this log occurred in. Use the<br /> [**Log.getTransaction**](/content/classes/Log.mdx#gettransaction) to get the <br /> [**TransactionResponse](/content/type-aliases/TransactionResponse.mdx). |
| `transactionIndex` | `readonly` | `number` | The index within the transaction of this log. |
