A **ContractTransactionReceipt** includes the parsed logs from a
 [**TransactionReceipt**](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).

## Extends

- [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx)

## Properties

| Property | Modifier | Type | Description | Inherited from |
| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `#logs` | `private` | readonly [`Log`](/content/classes/Log.mdx)[] | The root hash of this transaction.<br /><br /> This is no present and was only included in pre-byzantium blocks, but<br /> could be used to validate certain parts of the receipt. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`#logs` |
| `blockHash` | `readonly` | `string` | The block hash of the [**Block**](/content/classes/Block.mdx) this transaction was included in. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`blockHash` |
| `blockNumber` | `readonly` | `number` | The block number of the [**Block**](/content/classes/Block.mdx) this transaction was included in. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`blockNumber` |
| `contractAddress` | `readonly` | `null` \| `string` | The address of the contract if the transaction was directly<br /> responsible for deploying one.<br /><br /> This is non-null **only** if the `to` is empty and the `data`<br /> was successfully executed as initcode. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`contractAddress` |
| `cumulativeGasUsed` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The amount of gas used by all transactions within the block for this<br /> and all transactions with a lower `index`.<br /><br /> This is generally not useful for developers but can be used to<br /> validate certain aspects of execution. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`cumulativeGasUsed` |
| `from` | `readonly` | `string` | The sender of the transaction. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`from` |
| `gasPrice` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The actual gas price used during execution.<br /><br /> Due to the complexity of [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) this value can only<br /> be caluclated after the transaction has been mined, snce the base<br /> fee is protocol-enforced. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`gasPrice` |
| `gasUsed` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The actual amount of gas used by this transaction.<br /><br /> When creating a transaction, the amount of gas that will be used can<br /> only be approximated, but the sender must pay the gas fee for the<br /> entire gas limit. After the transaction, the difference is refunded. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`gasUsed` |
| `hash` | `readonly` | `string` | The transaction hash. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`hash` |
| `index` | `readonly` | `number` | The index of this transaction within the block transactions. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`index` |
| `logsBloom` | `readonly` | `string` | The bloom filter bytes that represent all logs that occurred within<br /> this transaction. This is generally not useful for most developers,<br /> but can be used to validate the included logs. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`logsBloom` |
| `provider` | `readonly` | [`Provider`](/content/interfaces/Provider.mdx) | The provider connected to the log used to fetch additional details<br /> if necessary. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`provider` |
| `status` | `readonly` | `null` \| `number` | The status of this transaction, indicating success (i.e. `1`) or<br /> a revert (i.e. `0`).<br /><br /> This is available in post-byzantium blocks, but some backends may<br /> backfill this value. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`status` |
| `to` | `readonly` | `null` \| `string` | The address the transaction was sent to. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`to` |
| `type` | `readonly` | `number` | The [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transaction type. | [`TransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/TransactionReceipt.mdx).`type` |
