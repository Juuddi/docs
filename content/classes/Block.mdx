A **Block** represents the data associated with a full block on
 Ethereum.

## Extended by

- [`MinedBlock`](/content/interfaces/MinedBlock.mdx)

## Implements

- [`BlockParams`](/content/interfaces/BlockParams.mdx)
- `Iterable`\<`string`\>

## Constructors

### new Block()

```ts
new Block(block, provider): Block
```

Create a new **Block** object.

 This should generally not be necessary as the unless implementing a
 low-level library.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| :------ | :------ |
| `block` | [`BlockParams`](/content/interfaces/BlockParams.mdx) |
| `provider` | [`Provider`](/content/interfaces/Provider.mdx) |

#### Returns

[`Block`](/content/classes/Block.mdx)

## Properties

| Property | Modifier | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `baseFeePerGas` | `readonly` | `null` \| `bigint` | The base fee per gas that all transactions in this block were<br /> charged.<br /><br /> This adjusts after each block, depending on how congested the network<br /> is. |
| `difficulty` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The difficulty target.<br /><br /> On legacy networks, this is the proof-of-work target required<br /> for a block to meet the protocol rules to be included.<br /><br /> On modern networks, this is a random number arrived at using<br /> randao.  @TODO: Find links? |
| `extraData` | `readonly` | `string` | Any extra data the validator wished to include. |
| `gasLimit` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The total gas limit for this block. |
| `gasUsed` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The total gas used in this block. |
| `hash` | `readonly` | `null` \| `string` | The block hash.<br /><br /> This hash includes all properties, so can be safely used to identify<br /> an exact set of block properties. |
| `miner` | `readonly` | `string` | The miner coinbase address, wihch receives any subsidies for<br /> including this block. |
| `nonce` | `readonly` | `string` | The nonce.<br /><br /> On legacy networks, this is the random number inserted which<br /> permitted the difficulty target to be reached. |
| `number` | `readonly` | `number` \| `number`[] | The block number, sometimes called the block height. This is a<br /> sequential number that is one higher than the parent block. |
| `parentHash` | `readonly` | `string` \| `string`[] | The block hash of the parent block. |
| `provider` | `readonly` | [`Provider`](/content/interfaces/Provider.mdx) | The provider connected to the block used to fetch additional details<br /> if necessary. |
| `timestamp` | `readonly` | `number` | The timestamp for this block, which is the number of seconds since<br /> epoch that this block was included. |

## Accessors

### date

```ts
get date(): null | Date
```

The [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
 this block was included at.

#### Returns

`null` \| `Date`

***

### length

```ts
get length(): number
```

The number of transactions in this block.

#### Returns

`number`

#### Source

[src.ts/providers/provider.ts:777](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quais-6.js/blob/3f482dd134064d41657ff7dc9ba8162f741c9c83/src.ts/providers/provider.ts#L777)

***

### prefetchedTransactions

```ts
get prefetchedTransactions(): TransactionResponse[]
```

Returns the complete transactions, in the order they
 were executed within the block.

 This is only available for blocks which prefetched
 transactions, by passing `true` to `prefetchTxs`
 into [**getBlock**](/content/interfaces/Provider.mdx#getblock).

#### Returns

[`TransactionResponse`](/content/type-aliases/TransactionResponse.mdx)[]

***

### transactions

```ts
get transactions(): readonly string[]
```

Returns the list of transaction hashes, in the order
 they were executed within the block.

#### Returns

readonly `string`[]

#### Source

[src.ts/providers/provider.ts:655](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quais-6.js/blob/3f482dd134064d41657ff7dc9ba8162f741c9c83/src.ts/providers/provider.ts#L655)

## Methods

### getPrefetchedTransaction()

```ts
getPrefetchedTransaction(indexOrHash): TransactionResponse
```

If a **Block** was fetched with a request to include the transactions
 this will allow synchronous access to those transactions.

 If the transactions were not prefetched, this will throw.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `indexOrHash` | `string` \| `number` | The index or hash of the transaction. |

#### Returns

[`TransactionResponse`](/content/type-aliases/TransactionResponse.mdx)

The transaction.

***

### getTransaction()

```ts
getTransaction(indexOrHash): Promise<TransactionResponse>
```

Get the transaction at `index` within this block.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `indexOrHash` | `string` \| `number` | The index or hash of the transaction. |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`TransactionResponse`](/content/type-aliases/TransactionResponse.mdx)\>

A promise resolving to the transaction.

***

### isMined()

```ts
isMined(): this is MinedBlock
```

Returns true if this block been mined. This provides a type guard
 for all properties on a [**MinedBlock**](/content/interfaces/MinedBlock.mdx).

#### Returns

`this is MinedBlock`

True if the block has been mined.
