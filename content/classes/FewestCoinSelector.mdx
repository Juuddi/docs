The FewestCoinSelector class provides a coin selection algorithm that selects
 the fewest UTXOs required to meet the target amount. This algorithm is useful
 for minimizing the size of the transaction and the fees associated with it.

 This class is a sub-class of AbstractCoinSelector | **AbstractCoinSelector** and implements the
 AbstractCoinSelector.performSelection | **performSelection** method to provide the actual coin selection logic.

## Extends

- `AbstractCoinSelector`

## Constructors

### new FewestCoinSelector()

```ts
new FewestCoinSelector(availableUXTOs): FewestCoinSelector
```

Constructs a new AbstractCoinSelector instance with an empty UTXO array.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default value |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `availableUXTOs` | `UTXOEntry`[] | `[]` |

#### Returns

[`FewestCoinSelector`](/content/classes/FewestCoinSelector.mdx)

#### Inherited from

`AbstractCoinSelector.constructor`

## Methods

### performSelection()

```ts
performSelection(target): SelectedCoinsResult
```

The largest first coin selection algorithm.

 This algorithm selects the largest UTXOs first, and continues to select UTXOs until the
 target amount is reached. If the total value of the selected UTXOs is greater than the
 target amount, the remaining value is returned as a change output.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `target` | `SpendTarget` | The target amount to spend. |

#### Returns

`SelectedCoinsResult`

The selected UTXOs and change outputs.

#### Overrides

`AbstractCoinSelector.performSelection`
