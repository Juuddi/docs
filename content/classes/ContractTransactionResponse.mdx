| `blockHash` | `readonly` | `null` \| `string` | The blockHash of the block that this transaction was included in.<br /><br /> This is `null` for pending transactions. | `QuaiTransactionResponse.blockHash` |
| `blockNumber` | `readonly` | `null` \| `number` | The block number of the block that this transaction was included in.<br /><br /> This is `null` for pending transactions. | `QuaiTransactionResponse.blockNumber` |

| `data` | `readonly` | `string` | The data. | `QuaiTransactionResponse.data` |
| `from` | `readonly` | `string` | The sender of this transaction. It is implicitly computed<br /> from the transaction pre-image hash (as the digest) and the<br /> [**signature** ](/content/classes/ContractTransactionResponse.mdx) using ecrecover. | `QuaiTransactionResponse.from` |
| `gasLimit` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The maximum units of gas this transaction can consume. If execution<br /> exceeds this, the entries transaction is reverted and the sender<br /> is charged for the full amount, despite not state changes being made. | `QuaiTransactionResponse.gasLimit` |

| `index` | `readonly` | `bigint` | The index within the block that this transaction resides at. | `QuaiTransactionResponse.index` |

| `to` | `readonly` | `null` \| `string` | The receiver of this transaction.<br /><br /> If `null`, then the transaction is an initcode transaction.<br /> This means the result of executing the [**data** ](/content/classes/ContractTransactionResponse.mdx) will be deployed<br /> as a new contract on chain (assuming it does not revert) and the<br /> address may be computed using [getCreateAddress](../functions/getCreateAddress). | `QuaiTransactionResponse.to` |

## Methods

### confirmations()

```ts
confirmations(): Promise<number>
```

Resolve to the number of confirmations this transaction has.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`number`\>

A promise resolving to the number of confirmations.

#### Inherited from

`QuaiTransactionResponse.confirmations`

#### Throws

If the block is not found.

***

### getBlock()

```ts
getBlock(shard): Promise<null | Block>
```

Resolves to the Block that this transaction was included in.

 This will return null if the transaction has not been included yet.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `shard` | `string` | The shard to fetch the block from. |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| [`Block`](/content/classes/Block.mdx)\>

A promise resolving to the block.

#### Inherited from

`QuaiTransactionResponse.getBlock`

***

### getTransaction()

```ts
getTransaction(): Promise<null | QuaiTransactionResponse>
```

Resolves to this transaction being re-requested from the
 provider. This can be used if you have an unmined transaction
 and wish to get an up-to-date populated instance.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| `QuaiTransactionResponse`\>

A promise resolving to the transaction, or null if not found.

#### Inherited from

`QuaiTransactionResponse.getTransaction`

#### Source

[src.ts/providers/provider.ts:1602](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quais-6.js/blob/3f482dd134064d41657ff7dc9ba8162f741c9c83/src.ts/providers/provider.ts#L1602)

***

### isMined()

```ts
isMined(): this is QuaiMinedTransactionResponse
```

Returns `true` if this transaction has been included.

 This is effective only as of the time the TransactionResponse
 was instantiated. To get up-to-date information, use
 QuaiTransactionResponse.getTransaction | **getTransaction**.

 This provides a Type Guard that this transaction will have
 non-null property values for properties that are null for
 unmined transactions.

#### Returns

`this is QuaiMinedTransactionResponse`

True if the transaction has been mined.

#### Inherited from

`QuaiTransactionResponse.isMined`

#### Throws

If the transaction was replaced, repriced, or cancelled.

***

### removedEvent()

```ts
removedEvent(): OrphanFilter
```

Returns a filter which can be used to listen for orphan events
 that evict this transaction.

#### Returns

[`OrphanFilter`](/content/type-aliases/OrphanFilter.mdx)

The orphan filter.

#### Inherited from

`QuaiTransactionResponse.removedEvent`

#### Source

***

### reorderedEvent()

```ts
reorderedEvent(other?): OrphanFilter
```

Returns a filter which can be used to listen for orphan events
 that re-order this event against `other`.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `other`? | [`TransactionResponse`](/content/type-aliases/TransactionResponse.mdx) | The other transaction to compare against. |

#### Returns

[`OrphanFilter`](/content/type-aliases/OrphanFilter.mdx)

The orphan filter.

#### Inherited from

`QuaiTransactionResponse.reorderedEvent`

#### Source

[src.ts/providers/provider.ts:1860](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quais-6.js/blob/3f482dd134064d41657ff7dc9ba8162f741c9c83/src.ts/providers/provider.ts#L1860)

***

### replaceableTransaction()

```ts
replaceableTransaction(startBlock): QuaiTransactionResponse
```

Returns a new TransactionResponse instance which has the ability to
 detect (and throw an error) if the transaction is replaced, which
 will begin scanning at `startBlock`.

 This should generally not be used by developers and is intended
 primarily for internal use. Setting an incorrect `startBlock` can
 have devastating performance consequences if used incorrectly.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `startBlock` | `number` | The block number to start scanning for replacements. |

#### Returns

`QuaiTransactionResponse`

***

### toJSON()

```ts
toJSON(): any
```

Returns a JSON-compatible representation of this transaction.

#### Returns

`any`

#### Inherited from

***

### wait()

```ts
wait(confirms?): Promise<null | ContractTransactionReceipt>
```

Resolves once this transaction has been mined and has
 `confirms` blocks including it (default: `1`) with an
 optional `timeout`.

 This can resolve to `null` only if `confirms` is `0`
 and the transaction has not been mined, otherwise this will
 wait until enough confirmations have completed.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `confirms`? | `number` | The number of confirmations to wait for. |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| [`ContractTransactionReceipt`](/content/classes/ContractTransactionReceipt.mdx)\>

The transaction receipt, or `null` if `confirms` is `0`.
