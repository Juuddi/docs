```ts
type ProviderEvent: string | (string | string[])[] | EventFilter | OrphanFilter;
```

A **ProviderEvent** provides the types of events that can be subscribed
 to on a [**Provider**](/content/interfaces/Provider.mdx).

 Each provider may include additional possible events it supports, but
 the most commonly supported are:

 **`"block"`** - calls the listener with the current block number on each
 new block.

 **`"error"`** - calls the listener on each async error that occurs during
 the event loop, with the error.

 **`"debug"`** - calls the listener on debug events, which can be used to
 troubleshoot network errors, provider problems, etc.

 **`transaction hash`** - calls the listener on each block after the
 transaction has been mined; generally `.once` is more appropriate for
 this event.

 **`Array`** - calls the listener on each log that matches the filter.

 [**EventFilter**](/content/interfaces/EventFilter.mdx) - calls the listener with each matching log
