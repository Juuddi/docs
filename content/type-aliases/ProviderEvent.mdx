# Type alias: ProviderEvent

> **ProviderEvent**: `string` \| (`string` \| `string`[])[] \| [`EventFilter`](../interfaces/EventFilter.md) \| [`OrphanFilter`](OrphanFilter.md)

A **ProviderEvent** provides the types of events that can be subscribed
 to on a [**Provider**](../interfaces/Provider.md).

 Each provider may include additional possible events it supports, but
 the most commonly supported are:

 **`"block"`** - calls the listener with the current block number on each
 new block.

 **`"error"`** - calls the listener on each async error that occurs during
 the event loop, with the error.

 **`"debug"`** - calls the listener on debug events, which can be used to
 troubleshoot network errors, provider problems, etc.

 **`transaction hash`** - calls the listener on each block after the
 transaction has been mined; generally `.once` is more appropriate for
 this event.

 **`Array`** - calls the listener on each log that matches the filter.

 [**EventFilter**](../interfaces/EventFilter.md) - calls the listener with each matching log
