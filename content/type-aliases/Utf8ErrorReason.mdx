# Type alias: Utf8ErrorReason

> **Utf8ErrorReason**: `"UNEXPECTED_CONTINUE"` \| `"BAD_PREFIX"` \| `"OVERRUN"` \| `"MISSING_CONTINUE"` \| `"OUT_OF_RANGE"` \| `"UTF16_SURROGATE"` \| `"OVERLONG"`

When using the UTF-8 error API the following errors can be intercepted
 and processed as the `reason` passed to the [**Utf8ErrorFunc**](Utf8ErrorFunc.md).

 **`"UNEXPECTED_CONTINUE"`** - a continuation byte was present where there
 was nothing to continue.

 **`"BAD_PREFIX"`** - an invalid (non-continuation) byte to start a
 UTF-8 codepoint was found.

 **`"OVERRUN"`** - the string is too short to process the expected
 codepoint length.

 **`"MISSING_CONTINUE"`** - a missing continuation byte was expected but
 not found. The `offset` indicates the index the continuation byte
 was expected at.

 **`"OUT_OF_RANGE"`** - the computed code point is outside the range
 for UTF-8. The `badCodepoint` indicates the computed codepoint, which was
 outside the valid UTF-8 range.

 **`"UTF16_SURROGATE"`** - the UTF-8 strings contained a UTF-16 surrogate
 pair. The `badCodepoint` is the computed codepoint, which was inside the
 UTF-16 surrogate range.

 **`"OVERLONG"`** - the string is an overlong representation. The
 `badCodepoint` indicates the computed codepoint, which has already
 been bounds checked.
