```ts
type BlockTag: BigNumberish | string;
```

A **BlockTag** specifies a specific block.

 **numeric value** - specifies the block height, where
 the genesis block is block 0; many operations accept a negative
 value which indicates the block number should be deducted from
 the most recent block. A numeric value may be a `number`, `bigint`,
 or a decimal of hex string.

 **blockhash** - specifies a specific block by its blockhash; this allows
 potentially orphaned blocks to be specifed, without ambiguity, but many
 backends do not support this for some operations.
