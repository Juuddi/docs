# Type alias: JsonRpcApiProviderOptions

> **JsonRpcApiProviderOptions**: `object`

Options for configuring a [**JsonRpcApiProvider**](../classes/JsonRpcApiProvider.md). 
 Much of this is targetted towards sub-classes, which often will 
 not expose any of these options to their consumers.

 **`polling`** - use the polling strategy is used immediately
 for events; otherwise, attempt to use filters and fall back onto
 polling (default: `false`)

 **`staticNetwork`** - do not request chain ID on requests to
 validate the underlying chain has not changed (default: `null`)

 This should **ONLY** be used if it is **certain** that the network
 cannot change, such as when using INFURA (since the URL dictates the
 network). If the network is assumed static and it does change, this
 can have tragic consequences. For example, this **CANNOT** be used
 with MetaMask, since the used can select a new network from the
 drop-down at any time.

 **`batchStallTime`** - how long (ms) to aggregate requests into a
 single batch. `0` indicates batching will only encompass the current
 event loop. If `batchMaxCount = 1`, this is ignored. (default: `10`)

 **`batchMaxSize`** - target maximum size (bytes) to allow per batch
 request (default: 1Mb)

 **`batchMaxCount`** - maximum number of requests to allow in a batch.
 If `batchMaxCount = 1`, then batching is disabled. (default: `100`)

 **`cacheTimeout`** - passed as [AbstractProviderOptions](../types-aliases/AbstractProviderOptions).
