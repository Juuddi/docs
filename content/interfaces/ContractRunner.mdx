A **ContractRunner** is a generic interface which defines an object
 capable of interacting with a Contract on the network.

 The more operations supported, the more utility it is capable of.

 The most common ContractRunners are [Providers](../classes/Provider) which enable
 read-only access and [Signers](../classes/Signer) which enable write-access.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `call?` | (`tx`: `QuaiTransactionRequest`) => `Promise`\<`string`\> | Required for pure, view or static calls to contracts. |
| `estimateGas?` | (`tx`: [`TransactionRequest`](/content/type-aliases/TransactionRequest.mdx)) => `Promise`\<`bigint`\> | Required to estimate gas. |
| `provider` | `null` \| [`Provider`](/content/interfaces/Provider.mdx) | The provider used for necessary state querying operations.<br /><br /> This can also point to the **ContractRunner** itself, in the<br /> case of an [AbstractProvider](../classes/AbstractProvider). |
| `sendTransaction?` | (`tx`: [`TransactionRequest`](/content/type-aliases/TransactionRequest.mdx)) => `Promise`\<[`TransactionResponse`](/content/type-aliases/TransactionResponse.mdx)\> | Required for state mutating calls |
