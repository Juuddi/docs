title: Addressable
---

An interface for objects which have an address, and can resolve it asyncronously.

This allows objects such as [Signer](Signer) or [Contract](../classes/Contract) to be used most places an address can
be, for example getting the [balance](../interfaces/Provider#getBalance).

## Extended by

- [`Signer`](/content/interfaces/Signer)

## Methods

### getAddress()

```ts
getAddress(): Promise<string>
```

Get the object address.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`string`\>
