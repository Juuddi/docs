a **TransactionReceiptParams** encodes the minimal required properties
 for a formatted transaction receipt.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `blockHash` | `string` | The block hash of the block that included this transaction. |
| `blockNumber` | `number` | The block number of the block that included this transaction. |
| `contractAddress` | `null` \| `string` | If the transaction was directly deploying a contract, the<br /> [**to**](/content/interfaces/TransactionReceiptParams.mdx) will be null, <br /> the `data` will be initcode and if successful, this will <br /> be the address of the contract deployed. |
| `cumulativeGasUsed` | `bigint` | The total amount of gas consumed during the entire block up to<br /> and including this transaction. |
| `effectiveGasPrice?` | `null` \| `bigint` | The actual gas price per gas charged for this transaction. |
| `from` | `string` | The sender of the transaction. |
| `gasPrice?` | `null` \| `bigint` | The actual gas price per gas charged for this transaction. |
| `gasUsed` | `bigint` | The amount of gas consumed executing this transaciton. |
| `hash` | `string` | The transaction hash. |
| `index` | `number` | The transaction index. |
| `logs` | readonly [`LogParams`](/content/interfaces/LogParams.mdx)[] | The logs emitted during the execution of this transaction. |
| `logsBloom` | `string` | The bloom filter for the logs emitted during execution of this<br /> transaction. |
| `status` | `null` \| `number` | The status of the transaction execution. If `1` then the<br /> the transaction returned success, if `0` then the transaction<br /> was reverted. For pre-byzantium blocks, this is usually null, but<br /> some nodes may have backfilled this data. |
| `to` | `null` \| `string` | The target of the transaction. If null, the transaction was trying<br /> to deploy a transaction with the `data` as the initi=code. |
