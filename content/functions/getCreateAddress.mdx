# Function: getCreateAddress()

> **getCreateAddress**(`tx`): `string`

Returns the address that would result from a `CREATE` for `tx`.

 This can be used to compute the address a contract will be
 deployed to by an EOA when sending a deployment transaction (i.e.
 when the `to` address is `null`).

 This can also be used to compute the address a contract will be
 deployed to by a contract, by using the contract's address as the
 `to` and the contract's nonce.

## Parameters

• **tx**

The transaction object.

• **tx.from**: `string`

The address of the sender.

• **tx.nonce**: [`BigNumberish`](../type-aliases/BigNumberish.md)

## Returns

`string`

## Example

```js
 from = "0x8ba1f109551bD432803012645Ac136ddd64DBA72";
 nonce = 5;

 getCreateAddress({ from, nonce });
 //_result:
 ```
