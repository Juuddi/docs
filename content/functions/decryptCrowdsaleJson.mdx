```ts
function decryptCrowdsaleJson(json, _password): CrowdsaleAccount
```

Before Ethereum launched, it was necessary to create a wallet
 format for backers to use, which would be used to receive ether
 as a reward for contributing to the project.

 The [Crowdsale Wallet](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethsaletool) format is now obsolete, but it is still
 useful to support and the additional code is fairly trivial as
 all the primitives required are used through core portions of
 the library.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `json` | `string` | The JSON data to decrypt. |
| `_password` | `string` \| `Uint8Array` | The password to decrypt the JSON data. |

## Returns

[`CrowdsaleAccount`](/content/type-aliases/CrowdsaleAccount.mdx)

The decrypted account.
