# Function: resolveAddress()

> **resolveAddress**(`target`): `string` \| `Promise`\<`string`\>

Resolves to an address for the `target`, which may be any
 supported address type, an [**Addressable**](../interfaces/Addressable) or a Promise which
 resolves to an address.

 If an ENS name is provided, but that name has not been correctly
 configured a [[UnconfiguredNameError]] is thrown.

## Parameters

• **target**: [`AddressLike`](../type-aliases/AddressLike.md)

The target to resolve to an address.

## Returns

`string` \| `Promise`\<`string`\>

The resolved address.

## TODO

revise this method as UnconfiguredNameError has been removed

## Example

```js
 addr = "0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F"

 // Addresses are return synchronously
 resolveAddress(addr, provider)
 //_result:

 // Address promises are resolved asynchronously
 resolveAddress(Promise.resolve(addr))
 //_result:

 // ENS names are resolved asynchronously
 resolveAddress("dai.tokens.quais.eth", provider)
 //_result:

 // Addressable objects are resolved asynchronously
 contract = new Contract(addr, [ ])
 resolveAddress(contract, provider)
 //_result:

 // Unconfigured ENS names reject
 resolveAddress("nothing-here.ricmoo.eth", provider)
 //_error:

 // ENS names require a NameResolver object passed in
 // (notice the provider was omitted)
 resolveAddress("nothing-here.ricmoo.eth")
 //_error:
 ```
