title: getAddress
---

```ts
function getAddress(address): string
```

Returns a normalized and checksumed address for `address`. This accepts non-checksum addresses, checksum addresses
and [[getIcapAddress]] formats.

The checksum in Ethereum uses the capitalization (upper-case vs lower-case) of the characters within an address to
encode its checksum, which offers, on average, a checksum of 15-bits.

If `address` contains both upper-case and lower-case, it is assumed to already be a checksum address and its checksum
is validated, and if the address fails its expected checksum an error is thrown.

If you wish the checksum of `address` to be ignore, it should be converted to lower-case (i.e. `.toLowercase()`)
before being passed in. This should be a very rare situation though, that you wish to bypass the safegaurds in place
to protect against an address that has been incorrectly copied from another source.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| :------ | :------ |
| `address` | `string` |

## Returns

`string`

## Example

```js
// Adds the checksum (via upper-casing specific letters)
getAddress('0x8ba1f109551bd432803012645ac136ddd64dba72');
//_result:

// Converts ICAP address and adds checksum
getAddress('XE65GB6LDNXYOFTX0NSV3FUWKOWIXAMJK36');
//_result:

// Throws an error if an address contains mixed case,
// but the checksum fails
getAddress('0x8Ba1f109551bD432803012645Ac136ddd64DBA72');
//_error:
```

## Todo

Revise this documentation as ICAP addresses are not supported

## Todo

GetIcapAddress has been removed, link must be revised or removed
