# Function: getAddress()

> **getAddress**(`address`): `string`

Returns a normalized and checksumed address for `address`.
 This accepts non-checksum addresses, checksum addresses and
 [[getIcapAddress]] formats.

 The checksum in Ethereum uses the capitalization (upper-case
 vs lower-case) of the characters within an address to encode
 its checksum, which offers, on average, a checksum of 15-bits.

 If `address` contains both upper-case and lower-case, it is
 assumed to already be a checksum address and its checksum is
 validated, and if the address fails its expected checksum an
 error is thrown.

 If you wish the checksum of `address` to be ignore, it should
 be converted to lower-case (i.e. `.toLowercase()`) before
 being passed in. This should be a very rare situation though,
 that you wish to bypass the safegaurds in place to protect
 against an address that has been incorrectly copied from another
 source.

## Parameters

• **address**: `string`

## Returns

`string`

## TODO

revise this documentation as ICAP addresses are not supported

## TODO

getIcapAddress has been removed, link must be revised or removed

## Example

```js
  // Adds the checksum (via upper-casing specific letters)
  getAddress("0x8ba1f109551bd432803012645ac136ddd64dba72")
  //_result:

  // Converts ICAP address and adds checksum
  getAddress("XE65GB6LDNXYOFTX0NSV3FUWKOWIXAMJK36");
  //_result:

  // Throws an error if an address contains mixed case,
  // but the checksum fails
  getAddress("0x8Ba1f109551bD432803012645Ac136ddd64DBA72")
  //_error:
 ```
